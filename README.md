# Theo.ai: Partial Blindness Accessibility Agent

[Official Documentation](https://theodocs.super.site) 

*Note that Theo currently only has support for Windows operating systems.*

**Theo** is a desktop accessibility assistant that lets users perform tasks through
natural language commands. Hold **Ctrl + Win** to speak: Theo transcribes your
request, interprets the screen, generates automation commands, executes them, and
confirms actions via text-to-speech.

## Project Layout
- `frontend/`: Electron UI + STT (push-to-talk) and fallback UX.
- `backend/`: Flask server, LLM classifier, main LLM orchestration, PyAutoGUI automation, TTS, and
  screenshot pipeline.

## Requirements
- Python
- pip
- Node.js and npm (for the Electron frontend)
*Assume latest versions for all dependencies

## Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the repo root:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_key
```

## Backend Setup
From `backend/`:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## Frontend Setup
From `frontend/`:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Notes
- The backend runs locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
- The `/ai` route currently expects `GET` requests with `?user_input=...`.
- Theo is a moderately sandboxed AI agent that controls PyAutoGUI automation clients. Ensure complete device safety when running tasks.    Theo is not designed for system level tasks. Theo is designed for UX automation.
